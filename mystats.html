        Coming from Alampur and doing my Bachelors in Computers, I developed interest in Web Development as well as Data Engineering. 
        Web Development includes using Frontend and Backend Technologies. Data Engineering is usually about transforming data from one point to another using tools as well as programming languages.
        SQL is common in both.

        <h5> Favorite Food - Biryani </h5>

        <p>My Favorite dish is Chicken Biryani. That too from Hyderabad. I like it due to its taste coming from wide variety of spices mixed properly. Hyderabad is an iconic location for this dish. Bawarchi is the first restraunt I tried this dish at. Later, I tasted in Paradise, but Bawarchi is the best. There are other varieties including prawns, mutton, etc., Main reason to like is its taste , texture and combination with curry.</p>
