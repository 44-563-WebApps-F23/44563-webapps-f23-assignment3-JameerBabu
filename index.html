    <h5> Favorite Vacation Spot - Alampur </h5>
    <p> Alampur is my Favorite vacation spot as it an abode of <b>Lord Bala Brahmeswara Swamy</b> and <b>Maa Jogulamba</b>.
        It is the main attraction of our district. District name was modified based on this temple. 
        It also has nice scenary with a river surrounding called <b>Tungabhadra</b>. 
        It is the only place on earth where 9 shiva lingas are placed in single location. 
        Next to the temple, there is an Archeological Department established office which preservers things related to ancient times.
